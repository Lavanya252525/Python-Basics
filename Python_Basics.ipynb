        "1. What is python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python is a programming language used worldwide by programmers and developers to perform certain tasks.\n",
        " - It is very easy to understand and write, making it popular. Also it is very compatible and versatile for usage due to its wide range of libraries and programming paradigms. Along with it has a large has a large and active community.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in python?\n",
        " - An interpreter in python is a program that translates and executes python code line by line. Python uses an interpreter instead of a complier, which results in ease to compile a program in python as you don't have to compile the whole program at once.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?\n",
        " - Pre-defined keywords are specific words that hold specific meaning as well as specific functions/ purpose such as print(), type(), input() and many more.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No, one can not use keywords as variable names as keywords hold specific functions. One could only use a keyword that starts with a letter(alphabet) or unerscore and it should not be a keyword or should not contain any special character.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in python?\n",
        " - Mutability refers to the ability of any object/container to change it's state or value after it has been created.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - In python, lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable because they are designed for different purposes. Lists are designed for flexible and dynamic data and on the other hand Tuples are designed for safety, performance and used in situations that need fixed data(like keys in a dictionary).\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python?\n",
        " - \"==\" Operator is a comparison operator and is used to check if the value of two variables are the same.\n",
        " - \"is\" Operator is an identity operator which is used to check if two variables point to the same object in the memory.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in python?\n",
        " - Logical operators in python are special keywords (AND, OR, NOT) used to combine or modify boolean expressions and return a True or False results based on logic.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in python?\n",
        " - Type Casting is the process of changing the data type of a value/object. It is done because while executing/computation using operators, there could be a mismatch between the two data types.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        " - Implicit type casting is performed automatically by python while performing operations involving different data types.\n",
        " - Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like- int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in python?\n",
        " - The purpose of conditional statements in python is to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions/predictions. They allow the program to run different blocks of code depending on wether the condition is True or False. This helps the program behave differently in different situations- just like how we make decisions in real life.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        " - Elif statement is used when one has multiple cases of conditions. Python checks conditions from top to bottom. as soon as it finds a condition that is True, it executes that block and skips the rest. If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if present) runs.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " - While loop statement repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met. While loops are based on a condition and the syntax is- While condition:.\n",
        " - For loop statement iterate over a sequence of elements i.e Strings. List, Range, etc. Syntax for For loop statement is- for item in sequence:.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        " - A while loop is more suitable when you don't know how many times something will happen- like waiting for the correct i.e Asking a user for the correct password or their email. Here, You don't know how many attempts the user will need and the while loop keeps running until the correct password is entered.\n",
        " - A For loop isn't ideal here because it runs a fixed number of times and you want the loop to continue as long as a condition is not met.\n"
